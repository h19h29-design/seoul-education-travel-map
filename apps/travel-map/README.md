# Seoul education travel map

This public no-login map previews routes and policy calculations. It is not an authorization or payment system. Public deployment is blocked until an approved live institution snapshot exists and manual release review is complete. Never promote test fixtures or synthetic institutions to `resources/institution-snapshots`.

## Local setup and offline checks

Run from the repository root:

```sh
uv sync --project apps/travel-map --frozen --dev
uv run --project apps/travel-map pytest apps/travel-map/tests -q
uv run --project apps/travel-map ruff check apps/travel-map/app apps/travel-map/tests apps/travel-map/scripts
uv run --project apps/travel-map mypy apps/travel-map/app apps/travel-map/scripts
pnpm --dir apps/travel-map install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --dir apps/travel-map test:e2e
```

Copy the template only for local development. Never commit the result or put credentials in shell history, screenshots, issues, or logs.

```sh
cp apps/travel-map/.env.example apps/travel-map/.env
uv run --project apps/travel-map uvicorn app.main:app \
  --env-file apps/travel-map/.env --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
```

The application process and operator scripts are intentionally run from the
repository root with an explicit `--env-file apps/travel-map/.env`. The file is
local-only; it never overrides environment variables supplied by the deployment
platform, and neither script prints its values. Production uses the platform
secret manager rather than this file.

Register the exact public HTTPS app domain in Kakao Developers and restrict `KAKAO_JAVASCRIPT_KEY` to that domain. It is browser-only. `KAKAO_REST_API_KEY` is server-only and must never be sent to a browser or used as the JavaScript key. Store these server-side values in the deployment secret manager:

- `KAKAO_REST_API_KEY` for place and Kakao route calls.
- `SEOUL_TRANSIT_SERVICE_KEY` for Seoul transit routing.
- `OPINET_CERT_KEY` for fuel-price lookups.
- `NEIS_API_KEY` and `KINDERGARTEN_API_KEY` only for institution synchronization.

Production also requires explicit canonical HTTPS `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and exact `ALLOWED_HOSTS`. The process fails before serving when they or runtime route credentials are incomplete.

## Provider extension points

Stage A fixes the registry order as Seoul Transit, Kakao Transit, Kakao Car,
and Kakao Walk. The follow-on plans are
[`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-10-seoul-public-road-routing-engine.md`](../../docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-10-seoul-public-road-routing-engine.md)
and
[`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-10-seoul-public-walk-routing-engine.md`](../../docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-10-seoul-public-walk-routing-engine.md).

Stage B changes only `build_car_provider_chain()` and retains the WALK-chain
regression test. Stage C changes only `build_walk_provider_chain()` and retains
the CAR-chain regression test. A public provider must not be promoted ahead of
Kakao as primary until it passes gold-route validation, missing-data detection,
and performance and outage fallback verification.

## Institution snapshot synchronization

Production accepts only the normalized snapshot selected by `resources/institution-snapshots/current.json`. Its pointer, approval metadata, hashes, and row schemas are validated at image build and startup. Never copy from `tests/fixtures` to this directory.

The snapshot workflow below is administrator-only. The public map does not
expose review or approval controls.

```sh
# 1. Networked, credentialed: creates .<id>.candidate only.
uv run --project apps/travel-map python apps/travel-map/scripts/sync-institutions.py \
  --env-file /secure/path/travel-map-sync.env

# 2. Credential-free: inspect source counts, observation-date histograms,
#    quarantine IDs, coordinate quality, provenance hashes, and diff.
uv run --project apps/travel-map python \
  apps/travel-map/scripts/review-institution-snapshot.py \
  --snapshot-id '<candidate-id>'

# 3. After a data steward independently records the review, publish exactly
#    the inspected digest. This is the only command that can update current.json.
uv run --project apps/travel-map python \
  apps/travel-map/scripts/approve-institution-snapshot.py \
  --snapshot-id '<candidate-id>' --review-digest '<64-lowercase-hex>' \
  --reviewer-role data-steward
```

The expected NEIS observation-date distribution is `1413/1/1` until official
source dates converge. This histogram is review provenance: it is neither an
automatic rejection nor permission to normalize or collapse distinct dates.
Release remains blocked until step 3 publishes the independently reviewed
digest. A missing or invalid approved snapshot is a release blocker, never
permission to substitute a sample catalog.

Coordinate recovery remains fail-closed. The geocoder treats only the leading
`서울특별시`, `서울시`, and `서울` tokens as equivalent; the district, road name,
building number, and every remaining token must match exactly, and exactly one
Kakao road-address result must remain. It does not issue fallback or keyword
requests and does not lower the 98% quality gate.

Completing offline tests does not authorize another live sync. Obtain explicit
approval for one candidate-only run, inspect only aggregate coordinate-quality
and provenance counts, then use the separate review and approval commands. Never
approve a candidate that still reports a coordinate-quality issue.

### Temporary school-count variance review (administrators only)

The temporary population profile exists because the official preliminary
school-count table and the live source disclosures have different observation
dates and populations. It makes those differences explicit and reviewable; it
must not be used to silently redefine the official benchmark. The pinned source
contract is 1,415 NEIS rows fetched, 1,414 NEIS rows normalized, and 706
kindergarten rows for disclosure timing `20261` as of `2026-04-01`.

The six reviewed comparisons below use signed `actual - expected` differences:

| Category | Official expected | Profile actual | Signed difference |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Elementary school | 609 | 610 | +1 |
| Middle school | 390 | 390 | 0 |
| High school | 319 | 319 | 0 |
| Special school | 32 | 32 | 0 |
| Miscellaneous school | 18 | 22 | +4 |
| Kindergarten | 724 | 706 | -18 |

Broadcast middle/high schools and foreign schools remain in the normalized
catalog as supplementary populations, but they are not added to the benchmark
actuals above. The 18 lifelong-school rows remain quarantined pending official
classification. The single joint workshop row is nonselectable and excluded
from the normalized NEIS population.

For every candidate, run the sync, inspect the emitted
`PRE_PROMOTION_RECONCILIATION`, generate and inspect the credential-free review
packet, and only then pass that exact packet digest to the separate approval
command as a `data-steward`. Synchronization itself never approves or updates
`current.json`. Do not change the population profile unless there is new
official evidence, a design review, passing tests, and explicit `data-steward`
approval. General-user instructions and public UI copy must not expose internal
population labels, quarantined identifiers, provenance hashes, or credentials;
these details belong only in the administrator review workflow.

### NEIS lifelong-school quarantine review

The sync command loads the reviewed NEIS quarantine policy from
`resources/institution-sources/neis-unclassified-school-kinds.csv`. Its current
total is 18 and it contains exactly these labels and counts:

- `평생학교(고)-2년6학기`: 7
- `평생학교(고)-3년6학기`: 4
- `평생학교(중)-2년6학기`: 5
- `평생학교(초)-3년6학기`: 2

These entries must remain `UNCLASSIFIED_SCHOOL` with `REVIEW_REQUIRED` status;
they are quarantine records, not selectable schools. Before copying the review
digest in step 3, inspect the pre-promotion audit's
`reconciliation.unclassifiedSchoolKindCounts` and confirm it matches the four
labels above. A new label or any count drift fails closed: stop the workflow,
do not approve the candidate, and investigate the official source. When
official classification or revised statistics become available, make a new
reviewed policy change before resuming synchronization.

## Live smoke and manual approval

The live smoke runs exactly three bounded cases only after opt-in, a valid approved snapshot, and all runtime provider credentials:

```sh
TRAVEL_MAP_LIVE_SMOKE=1 uv run --project apps/travel-map python \
  apps/travel-map/scripts/smoke-live.py --env-file apps/travel-map/.env
```

Without `TRAVEL_MAP_LIVE_SMOKE=1`, with missing credentials, or with no approved snapshot, it exits `2` and emits one safe status. Success output has only case ID, provider status, route count, decision, and latency. Provider status distinguishes available routes, a provider outage, no route, and an out-of-coverage request that deliberately made no provider call. It never emits institution IDs, names, addresses, coordinates, route IDs, allowance amounts, credentials, headers, or raw provider responses.

Do not approve a release from this smoke alone. Record a manual review of 30 origin/destination pairs stratified across all 25 Seoul districts, institution types, and foundation types. Verify each pair's address and main-gate coordinate, multiple routes, round-trip classification near the 12 km boundary, separation of mobility cost from allowance, source references, and lookup time. A designated reviewer must record approval.

## Quotas, privacy, and rule provenance

Provider `503` and rate-limit results are unavailable data, not a reason to retry aggressively or invent a route. Respect `Retry-After`, stop the affected live check, inspect provider status privately, then retry only after its window. Do not add destination queries, addresses, route geometry, or credentials to logs or telemetry.

The current rule sources are versioned in `resources/rules/local-travel-2026-07-01.json`:

- [국가법령정보센터 여비규정](https://www.law.go.kr/LSW/lsInfoP.do?lsiSeq=287535)
- [국가법령정보센터 서울특별시교육청 조례](https://www.law.go.kr/LSW/ordinInfoP.do?ordinSeq=2099835)
- [인사혁신처 보수·여비 안내](https://www.mpm.go.kr/mpm/info/resultPay/payBoard/?boardId=bbs_0000000000000035&category=%EB%B3%B4%EC%88%98&cntId=693&mode=view)

## Container and release gate

The Docker context is staged from a reviewed workspace: it validates SGIS source and normalized geodata hashes, hash-pinned rule payloads, and `current.json` before Docker is consulted. The staged context contains no `.env`, Git metadata, source/raw provider data, geodata source, institution-source input, tests, E2E files, artifacts, or historical snapshots—only the snapshot selected by `current.json`. The runtime image uses UID `10001` and contains only application code, rules, normalized geodata/manifest, and that one approved institution snapshot. It has a `/healthz` health check and runs in production mode, so invalid settings or artifacts fail closed before serving traffic.

Run the single release command only after the approved snapshot and deployment secrets exist:

```sh
./apps/travel-map/scripts/release-gate.sh
```

It completes verified-artifact preflight before checking Docker, then runs offline gates and produces `seoul-education-travel-map:0.1.0` only when `current.json` selects a verified snapshot. Supply production secrets and allow-lists through the platform secret manager; never bake them into the image or a saved command.

For an explicit build and local production run, prepare the same minimal context
first. The supported build context is the staged directory below; do not run
`docker build apps/travel-map`, which can include retained snapshot history.

```sh
context_parent=$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/travel-map-release.XXXXXX")
trap 'rm -rf -- "$context_parent"' EXIT HUP INT TERM
snapshot_id=$(uv run --project apps/travel-map python \
  apps/travel-map/scripts/prepare-release-context.py \
  --source apps/travel-map --destination "$context_parent/context")
docker build --build-arg SNAPSHOT_ID="$snapshot_id" \
  -t seoul-education-travel-map:0.1.0 "$context_parent/context"
docker run --rm --init -p 8080:8080 \
  --env-file /secure/path/travel-map-production.env \
  seoul-education-travel-map:0.1.0
```

## NAS production operations (administrators only)

The public NAS deployment is available at
<https://travel.h19h19.com>. Cloudflare Tunnel is the only supported public
entry point. The former `travel.h19h19.synology.me` endpoint is retained only
as a temporary rollback path and must not be published as the service URL.
GitHub
[`h19h29-design/seoul-education-travel-map`](https://github.com/h19h29-design/seoul-education-travel-map)
is the canonical source and GitLab
[`h19h19/seoul-education-travel-map`](https://gitlab.aigov.go.kr/h19h19/seoul-education-travel-map)
is its automated mirror. Do not build from the older monorepo checkout or from
files copied out of a running container. GitHub Actions runs warning-strict
Python tests, Ruff, mypy, and Playwright before a reviewed change is considered
releasable.

Keep the stateless application and Docker image on SSD volume `/volume1`. The
image is about 271 MiB and the allowlisted build context is about 3.3 MiB, so
moving the live workload to the 10 TB archive volume would add latency without
a meaningful capacity benefit. Keep recovery copies on `/volume2` instead:

- Compose: `/volume1/docker/seoul-education-travel-map/compose.yml`
- Cloudflare Compose:
  `/volume1/docker/seoul-education-travel-map/cloudflared-compose.yml`
- Cloudflare tunnel token:
  `/volume1/docker/seoul-education-travel-map/cloudflared-token`
  (`0400`, owned by the connector UID; never print or copy its value)
- Runtime secrets: `/volume1/docker/seoul-education-travel-map/runtime.env`
  (`0600 root:root`)
- Backups: `/volume2/docker-1/backups/seoul-education-travel-map/<UTC stamp>`
  (`0700 root:root`; files `0600 root:root`)

The Compose service binds only `127.0.0.1:18080`, uses a read-only root
filesystem, drops all capabilities, and reaches the public internet only via
the Cloudflare Tunnel connector. The connector named
`seoul-education-travel-map-nas` routes `travel.h19h19.com` to
`http://127.0.0.1:18080`, with a terminal HTTP 404 catch-all. Its tunnel ID is
`46f538d4-52b1-4a7f-8b56-694c1050bdf3`. Pin the connector to
`cloudflare/cloudflared@sha256:0aa26e284f05e6c77ae375b8c9c11d9eb6a448fb7bcd8d40f31cb6176189eb38`
(`2026.8.2`) and keep its token outside Compose and Git. Configure Docker's
`json-file` logger with `max-size: 10m` and `max-file: 5`. Do not remove the
previous image until the replacement has passed health and route checks.

The production allow-lists must name the Cloudflare hostname exactly:

```text
ALLOWED_HOSTS=["127.0.0.1","localhost","travel.h19h19.com","travel.h19h19.synology.me"]
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=["https://travel.h19h19.com","https://travel.h19h19.synology.me"]
```

The Synology values exist only to make rollback possible. Kakao Developers
must allow the exact JavaScript SDK domain `https://travel.h19h19.com`; its
REST key remains server-only.

For each update:

1. Confirm GitLab and GitHub `main` point to the same reviewed commit.
2. Stage the allowlisted context with `prepare-release-context.py`, then build a
   new immutable image tag containing the snapshot ID and short Git SHA. Set
   `COPYFILE_DISABLE=1` when archiving or transferring the context from macOS,
   and require `find <context> -name '._*' -o -name '.DS_Store'` to return no
   paths before the Docker build.
3. Copy `compose.yml` and the current `runtime.env`, and save the current image,
   to a new
   root-only backup directory on `/volume2`.
4. Change only the image tag in Compose and run `docker compose up -d`.
   Restart the Cloudflare connector separately only when its pinned image,
   token, or remote ingress configuration changes.
5. Require container health plus internal and public `/healthz`, HTTPS/TLS,
   CSP, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, and
   the 30-case route review before removing any rollback asset. Confirm the
   public response is served through Cloudflare and the Kakao map renders.
   Triage browser console errors without weakening CSP. Also confirm the final image contains no
   `._*`, `.DS_Store`, `.env`, tests, raw data, or build artifacts.
6. To roll back, restore the preceding image tag in Compose and run
   `docker compose up -d` again. If the tunnel itself is unavailable, enable
   the retained Synology endpoint only for the rollback window rather than
   changing the published service URL.

Useful non-secret checks on the NAS are:

```sh
docker compose -f /volume1/docker/seoul-education-travel-map/compose.yml ps
docker compose -f /volume1/docker/seoul-education-travel-map/cloudflared-compose.yml ps
curl -fsS -H 'Host: travel.h19h19.com' http://127.0.0.1:18080/healthz
curl -fsS https://travel.h19h19.com/healthz
```

The 2026-08-16 cutover backup is stored at
`/volume2/docker-1/backups/seoul-education-travel-map/cloudflare-cutover-20260816T081726Z`.
The deployed application image is
`seoul-education-travel-map:20260814T004744Z-469c13f`; the Cloudflare connector
has four active QUIC registrations under normal operation.

Create a new `/volume2` backup after every runtime-secret rotation even if the
application image is unchanged. Never copy a runtime environment file into the
Git repository, Docker context, image, CI artifact, or administrator report.

The 2026-08-14 30-case review covered all 25 Seoul districts, 11 institution
types, three foundation types, two 12 km buffer cases, and one out-of-coverage
case. Kakao transit, walk, and car routes remained available. The separate
Seoul bus API still needs a key approved specifically for the public-data
`ws.bus.go.kr` service, and the current Opinet key returns an empty price list;
until those operator issues are resolved, the application keeps the Kakao
routes and reports unavailable fuel cost as unknown rather than estimating it.

After the 2026-08-16 Cloudflare cutover, external verification confirmed DNS
proxying, HTTP/2, `/healthz`, CSP and security headers, the Kakao map SDK with
21 rendered tiles, institution/place lookup, and a live trip preview containing
transit, car, and walk routes. Cloudflare's optional analytics beacon and one
optional Kakao SDK inline style remain blocked by the strict CSP; the map and
route features operate without relaxing that policy. This does not change the
Seoul bus and Opinet limitations above.
